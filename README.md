# Biological Age Estimation using DNA Methylation Data

**Authors:** Jay Katyan, Praneeth Uppari, Sharanya Pathakota  

This project focuses on using DNA Methylation sites (the presence of these epigenetic markers) as the features to predict biological age. This paper aims to assess the effectiveness of various popular models in this field by evaluating their performance on a distinct data set, ultimately identifying the model with the highest efficacy. This paper focuses on elastic-net regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, and nu-support vector regression. Initially, we used a random sample of 20,000 CpG sites out of 485,512 sites as our features to be computationally viable. During this initial phase, we found support vector machine (SVM) to be the most effective. Through research, we were able to reduce the number of CpG sites used to a specific 353 sites that were found to be most indicative of biological age. After retraining our models, we observed across-the-board enhancements in mean absolute error values and correlation coefficients for both the validation and test sets. However, SVM still emerged as the most effective model. To demonstrate a practical application, we developed a classifier capable of predicting disease types based on each sampleâ€™s methylation data. This model underscores the versatility of BA prediction and the potential for disease classification.
